# Phase 1 SiRA Smoke Readiness

Status: **eligible for explicit authorization; not authorized**

Prepared: 2026-08-08

## Exact next run plan

- Experiment: `EXP-0001`
- Profile plan ID: `PLAN-EXP0001-SMOKE`
- Profile record:
  `experiments/EXP-0001-sira-simulative-vs-reactive/run-plans/smoke.yaml`
- Condition plans: `RUN-EXP0001-SMOKE-REACTIVE` followed by
  `RUN-EXP0001-SMOKE-SIMULATIVE`
- Pair: `PAIR-EXP0001-SMOKE-0000`
- Interpretation: prohibited (`interpretation_allowed: false`)

The profile and both condition plans remain unauthorized. This readiness record and
the proposed budget are not authorization. The pilot plan is not eligible.

## Exact user decision fields

A later current-turn authorization must state one value for every field below:

| Field | Locked or proposed value |
|---|---|
| `run_plan_id` | Exactly `PLAN-EXP0001-SMOKE` |
| `api_provider` | `OpenAI` |
| `model_revision` | Exactly `gpt-4o-2024-11-20`, used as a declared substitution for the unavailable historical `gpt-4o` serving revision |
| `maximum_api_cost_usd` | Proposed ceiling: `4.00`; the user must explicitly approve this value or a lower replacement after price reverification |
| `maximum_wall_time_seconds` | Proposed ceiling: `240` total, comprising at most `120` seconds per condition attempt |
| `required_cleanup` | Terminate the supervised process group and every browser child, verify zero live child processes, preserve and hash the attempt evidence, and perform no cloud mutation |

The authorization reference must identify that current user instruction. Within the
authorized T07 work item, the control plane may set
`paid_compute_allowed` and `prototype_execution_allowed` true only for this bounded
profile, set the profile and both condition authorization records to that reference,
bind `docs/PROJECT_STATE.yaml.authorized_run_profile` to the exact profile path and
SHA-256 plus the sealed canonical `condition_plan_sha256s`, bind both condition plans
to the same `profile_plan_id` and `profile_sha256`, and materialize condition-owned
budgets and command hashes.
Benchmark, training, and cloud-mutation permissions remain false. No field may be
inferred from this readiness document or from the proposed price record.

## Proposed API spend cap

The proposed profile cap is **USD 4.00**: two condition attempts, each limited to
200,000 model tokens and conservatively priced at the recorded USD 10.00 per million
output-token rate. The dated price record is
`experiments/EXP-0001-sira-simulative-vs-reactive/pricing.yaml` and must be reverified
before authorization. A changed provider rate, unavailable model revision, or
unbounded charge category stops preflight; it does not silently increase the cap.

## Required pre-execution materialization

T07 must complete these deterministic preflight obligations after authorization but
before the first live model, API, or browser action:

1. Bind the clean GIC Lab commit, pinned SiRA checkout, immutable model substitution,
   protocol hash, condition-owned configuration hashes, environment fingerprint, and
   exact argument-array command hashes.
2. Validate the complete authorized parent profile, require no unresolved execution
   blocker, verify every declared child plan, and materialize the exact canonical child
   fingerprint set. Reject any invoked plan outside that set even if it copies the
   profile ID, profile hash, or authorization reference.
3. Machine-diff the two resolved commands/configurations and permit only the declared
   condition and identity differences.
4. Enforce finite command-level token, API-cost, wall-time, tool-call, and output-byte
   limits; stop if the upstream surface cannot make them effective.
5. Redirect source session JSON, text logs, stdout, stderr, screenshots, and evaluator
   output into fresh harness-owned attempt roots before launch.
6. Pin and record the approved browser/runtime revision, supervise its process group,
   and verify the cleanup procedure without a live model/API call.
7. Verify required secret names without printing, persisting, hashing, or placing
   secret values in arguments, paths, events, or artifacts.

Failure of any preflight obligation stops T07 before execution and preserves the
authorization record as an unconsumed/blocked attempt; it does not relax the protocol.

## Expected artifacts

For each condition attempt and for the paired profile, retain and validate:

- the authorization reference, materialized run plan, resolved argument-array command,
  resolved configuration, and source/protocol/config/environment/command identities;
- raw upstream session JSON and text logs, stdout and stderr, browser screenshots and
  runtime identity, evaluator output when produced, and every failed or retried attempt;
- append-only normalized events, artifact records with byte sizes and SHA-256 hashes,
  token/model-call/tool-call/browser-action counts, wall time, and estimated API cost;
- one source-grounded `regulation_decision` record per condition with
  `source_kind: experiment_assignment`, the derived selected mode, the assignment
  policy/config revision when known, raw artifact or resolved-configuration references,
  and field-level provenance;
- null/unavailable status for confidence, override, fallback, critic, configurator,
  or per-step planning fields that the pinned source does not expose;
- pair-equivalence evidence showing that trace instrumentation did not change the
  treatment/control contract; and
- cleanup evidence showing process-group termination, zero live browser children,
  sealed append-only artifacts, and reconciled API/compute accounting.

These are artifact-execution and infrastructure records. The smoke may not classify
the EXP-0001 hypothesis or any RQ-H2K outcome.

## Rollback and cleanup

- Stop before launch on identity, command, configuration, secret, budget, or artifact-
  ownership drift.
- On any launched-attempt failure, terminate the complete process group and browser
  descendants, verify zero live children, retain the failed attempt under its immutable
  identity, hash what was captured, and record the stop reason.
- Never overwrite or reuse an attempt directory; a retry requires a new attempt
  identity and preserves the prior evidence.
- Do not delete raw evidence as rollback. Revert only unexecuted authorization-state
  materialization after its audit record is retained.
- No cloud resource is part of this profile, so cloud launch, storage mutation, and
  provider cleanup are prohibited.

## Unresolved nonblocking questions

- Dataset and trace public-release licensing/privacy rules remain unresolved; private,
  access-controlled smoke retention can proceed, but publication stays blocked.
- The final repository software/content licenses and publication identity remain open.
- Lambda credit terms and SR²AM service choices are later T11/T12 gates and do not
  block the SiRA smoke.
- RQ-H2K external-versus-explicit-model comparison feasibility remains undetermined.
  Missing optional regulation fields do not invalidate EXP-0001 when its primary
  evidence contract is complete.

## Future-track interpretation boundary

Any regulation-decision coverage or trace-sufficiency output is **infrastructure
evidence only**. A fixed reactive/simulative condition is an external experiment
assignment. It is not learned regulation, latent internalization, a new EXP-0001
condition, or evidence that an internal or external controller is superior.

All such outputs remain infrastructure evidence only; none is scientific outcome
evidence.
